# P212_loadframe
This project aims to build a simple GUI to efficiently interact with the loadframe at beamline P21.2.

## Ideas to implement
* Somewhat important
  * load control
  * height correction
  * cyclic deformation
* Not that important
  * broken sample
  * external strain feed-in
  * visible camera image
* Moonshot
  * DIC
